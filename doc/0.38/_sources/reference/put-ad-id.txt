PUT /ad/{id}
============

This URL updates the ad with the given ``id``. If the ad was successfully
updated then a **200 OK** is returned. The **optional** query parameter
``_body`` with value ``true`` or ``false`` can be used to influence
whether the response body contains the ad in the body (or not) in case of success.
By default, this value is ``true``.If the ad does not exist or
does not belong to the user the server returns **404 Not Found**. If the
``id`` is invalid, i.e. not a positive integer the server returns **400 Bad
Request**.

All writeable fields listed in :ref:`ad-fields` can be changed. Attempting to 
change a non-writeable field results in a **400 Bad Request**

All validation rules for creating an ad apply exactly the same.

Additionally, the following rules apply:

The :ref:`ad_totalBudget` can not be lower than the minimum budget as
defined in the category and also not be lower than the current value of
:ref:`ad_spentBudget`.

If the :ref:`ad_images` attribute contains links to images that need to be refreshed
then the ``refresh`` attribute has to be set to ``true``. This is only
necessary if the image has changed but the URL has not. See
:ref:`ad_image_objects` for more details.

.. note::

    The fields :ref:`ad_pageNumber` and :ref:`ad_suggestedCpcForPageOne` are
    currently expensive to compute. If you do not need their values consider
    excluding them to speed up the response. To exclude the fields add the
    following parameter to the request URL. ::

        ?_exclude=pageNumber,suggestedCpcForPageOne

.. note::

    You should not set ``refresh`` to ``true`` as a *good measure* to have the
    images refreshed on every update since this will increase the time it
    takes before the changes become active. Only set ``refresh`` to ``true``
    if the image has changed but the URL has not. Use the ``dateLastUpdated``
    attribute and the ``STATUS`` to determine whether the image needs to be
    refreshed.
