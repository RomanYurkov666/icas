GET /budget/seller
==================

.. list-table::
 :widths: 20 80

 * - Scope
   - ``api_ro`` or ``console_ro``

 * - Accept
   - ``application/sellside.amount-v1+json, application/json``

This URL returns two values. The current value of the seller-level budget of the current
user, and whether ads should be paused or not because of it. The ``amount`` field
contains the value in cents. A ``null`` value for ``amount`` means there is no seller-level
budget set for this seller. Please keep in mind that when the ``adsPaused`` value changes,
it can take a little while before the respective ads are all set to the correct status due
to asynchronicity.
